#  Iris Flower Classification

This repository contains a complete end-to-end data science project using the famous Iris flower dataset. The project covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling with a Random Forest Classifier, evaluation, and interpretation of results.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a classification model that can predict the species of Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for practicing classification algorithms.

## Dataset Description

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. The dataset is included in scikit-learn library and is loaded using `load_iris()` function.
